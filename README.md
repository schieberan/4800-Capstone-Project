# 4800-Capstone-Project

Please name branches and tag commits based on the issue you are working on. For example if you are working on Jira issue DEV4800-2 name your branch feature/DEV4800-taskName and start every commit feature for that branch with DEV4800-2

Example:

git commit -m "DEV4800-2 implemented feature"

This will keep our Jira board up to date with the code we work on.
